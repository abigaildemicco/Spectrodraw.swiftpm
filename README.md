# Spectrodraw.swiftpm
The app allows you to draw on a black board while listening to a music track accompanied by its spectrogram. The drawing will be saved in the Photo Library. The choice of the song is done by tapping the colorful bubbles floating on the screen. The technologies used are: PencilKit for drawing, PhotosUI for saving the image, AVKit for music, AVFoundation for capturing the track through the microphone and Accelerate for creating the spectrogram. I added some micro-animations in SwiftUI in order to create more interaction and guide you through a path. The idea is to set up a comfortable mood experience through sounds and colors lulling you to encourage you to experiment with brushes.
