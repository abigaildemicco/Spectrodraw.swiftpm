# Spectrodraw.swiftpm
The app allows you to **draw** on a black board while listening to a **music track** accompanied by its **spectrogram**. The drawing will be saved in the **Photo Library**. The choice of the song is done by tapping the colorful bubbles floating on the screen. I added some micro-animations in SwiftUI in order to create more interaction and guide you through a path.
